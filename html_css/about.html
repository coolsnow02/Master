The rationale behind the mankind’s search for alternative sources of energy could be attributed to two reasons. Firstly the coal and oil produce of the world is not renewable. This means that in the near future we are likely to run out of these fuel sources. Imagine a world without vehicles and electricity. We will be pushed back to the dark ages!

Secondly, mankind has been too unkind to the earth’s environment. Ever since the discovery of coal the amount of harmful gases that are emitted from the exhausts and industry furnace have killed some of the important elements of our atmosphere. This is definitely not the right way to repay the atmosphere which has been acting as a blanket preventing us from a variety of harmful elements of the outer space.

We have managed to create a huge hole in the ozone layer. The thick layer of ozone in the atmosphere prevents UV rays from the son from scorching our earth. The incidence of Ultra Violet rays on our skin could potentially bring us cancer. The depletion of ozone layer is due to the excessive release of gases which are emitted as a result of incomplete combustion of coal and other conventional fuels.

So many of us might have heard of the term global warming! Many of us find it unable to believe that our earth in a phase of destruction which we can prevent only through drastic measures.
